# Clojure Student Query

Welcome to the repository for an assignment on Functional Programming with Clojure. This project implements a basic query system in Clojure for managing student, course, and grade information.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a simple query system using Clojure. The system reads data from text files to create an in-memory database containing student, course, and grade information. The goal is to provide a functional interface for querying and analyzing the data.

## Features

- Display Courses: View the list of available courses.
- Display Students: See the details of enrolled students.
- Display Grades: Check the grades of students in various courses.
- Display Student Record: View a specific student's course record.
- Calculate GPA: Calculate a student's GPA based on grades and credits.
- Course Average: Compute the average grade for each course.
- Exit: Terminate the program.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/clojure-query-system.git
   ```

2. Make sure you have Clojure installed.

3. Navigate to the project directory.

4. Open your terminal and run the following command to start the program:

   ```bash
   clojure app.clj
   ```

5. Follow the menu prompts to interact with the data and perform different queries.

## Demonstrates

- Functional programming concepts using Clojure.
- Loading and processing data from text files.
- Implementing a basic command-line interface (CLI).
- Calculating GPA and course averages.
- Efficient string manipulation and data transformation.

## Note

- This project is designed to showcase your functional programming skills.
- Utilize Clojure's built-in functions for mapping, filtering, and reducing.
- The code is structured into separate files for better organization: `app.clj`, `menu.clj`, and `db.clj`.
- The data is loaded into appropriate data structures for querying without updates.
